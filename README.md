# PyTasc
A generic Python Tool for Assembling Source Code written in Python

This is a Python port of [tasc](https://github.com/hcpss-banderson/tasc) which
is written in PHP. I wrote this because I needed to asseble projects on servers
that did not have PHP installed. I found Python to be a more commonly installed.
